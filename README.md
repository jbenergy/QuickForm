QuickForm
====

QuickForm is a simple way to generate 3D geometries based upon the buildings shown on google maps. Using either the footprints that show up in the default map view or an actual image of the building in satellite view, a user can drop one of several predefined shapes on top of their building and adjust it to best match the building they desire to model. Once the user adds all the buildings they want in their urban environment, the program does some line adjustement and then creates [STL] [1] and [OSM (OpenStudioModel) geometries] [2].
                            

The iteration linked below is just a demo, but full functionality will be rolled into the Virtual PULSE Urban Modeling Platform in Spring 2015.
